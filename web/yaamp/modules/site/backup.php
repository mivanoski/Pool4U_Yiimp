<li>Q. Other anonymous mining pools require the -p switch with a fake password, do I need
that on my miner command line?</li>

<li>A. No, it's not necessary but it works with it too. It's just ignored.</li>

<li>Q. What happens if I leave before the next block is found?</li>
<li>A. Your shares are kept until the next block is found and you will receive payment
